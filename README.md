## Installation of  Julia
You will need to install Julia, and various packages by carefully following the detailed instructions [here](installation.md).
(Note that you do not need to separately install the Jupyter notebook -- it will be installed for you as part of the installation process. It is possible to use a pre-existing installation, but we recommend against it. This will install a new, separate copy of it.)



### Office hours
TBD

### Evaluation

*   5 problem sets, lowest score dropped. 25% for each of the other 4 problem sets.

*   Released on Tuesday and due the following Tuesday until May 5.

*   To pass, you must submit at least 4 problem sets with passing grades

*   No final exam

Problem sets consist of coding and will be submitted online.



### Windows users

If you use Windows, please download Git for Windows [here](https://gitforwindows.org)

### Getting the files

To get the files, use `git` from the command line (or from a GUI), as follows

- Clone the repository once with
```
git clone https://github.com/mitmath/6S083
```
This will create a new directory called `6S083` with the matierials.


- Update it to pull in new changes
```
git pull
```
This needs to be executed from within the directory. (Use `cd` to change directory.)
